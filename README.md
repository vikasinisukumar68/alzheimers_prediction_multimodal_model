# alzheimers_prediction-using-mutlimodal
The **Alzheimer's Stage Prediction (alzheimers\_multimodal)** project uses a multimodal deep learning model that combines MRI image data and seven key clinical features to predict the stage of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease. The model is deployed through a Streamlit interface for easy and interactive predictions.
